I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland advised by Prof. [Heng Huang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~heh45/).  where I am currently conducting research on Trustworthy Machine Learning. My work revolves around exploring the application of this field in various areas, such as computer vision, graph neural networks, and multi-modal retrieval. I am fortunate to collabrate with Prof. [Hongyang Zhang](https://hongyanz.github.io/) and Prof. [Aleksandar Bojchevski](https://abojchevski.github.io/).
